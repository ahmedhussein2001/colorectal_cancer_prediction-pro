# 🧬 Colorectal Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📍 Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of colorectal cancer in patients based on clinical and genetic features using supervised machine learning models. Early detection is critical in improving survival rates, and this model helps support diagnostic decisions.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze a medical dataset related to colorectal cancer diagnosis.
- Preprocess and clean the data (handle nulls, encode features).
- Train multiple machine learning classifiers.
- Evaluate models and select the best-performing one.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data analysis
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Workflow
1. **Data Understanding** – Examine features related to patient biomarkers and test results.
2. **Preprocessing** – Normalize numerical data, encode categorical features.
3. **Modeling** – Train/test split, train multiple classifiers.
4. **Evaluation** – Confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC.

## 📊 Sample Output
```bash
Model: Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 95%
Precision: 0.94
Recall: 0.96
AUC Score: 0.97
